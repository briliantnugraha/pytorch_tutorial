# pytorch_tutorial
 Pytorch tutorial on Mixup segmentation, SR and GAN, and Adversarial Samples

 Author: Brilian
 Target: Pytorch tutorial data augmentation Chapter 9
 How to use it:
 - Go to the main folder (pytorch_tutorial folder)
 - open cmd in that folder (or you could win+R -> cmd -> go to this folder)
 - Type python mixup_segmentation.py {training or mixup_augmentation} #without bracket {} -> for mixup segmentation
 - Type python mixup_segmentation.py training (label_smooth) -> for label smoothing
 - Type python mixup_segmentation.py plot_training -> for plotting training output (with or without label_smooth)
 - TYpe python mixup_segmentation.py detecting (adversarial) -> for using adversarial
 - Type python sr_tutorial training/detecting (for Super Resolution training/inference)
